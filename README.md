## üé® Customization

This portfolio is designed to be easily customized.

1.  **Update Your Information:**
    - Open `app/page.js`.
    - Modify the `portfolioData` object at the top of the file with your own bio, projects, skills, and contact information.

2.  **Change Your Profile Picture:**
    - Place your profile picture (e.g., `profile.jpg`) inside the `/public` directory.
    - The code in `app/page.js` already looks for `/profile.jpg`, so no code changes are needed if you use that name.
